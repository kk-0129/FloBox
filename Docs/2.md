# Basic Data-Type and Box Definitions

The subsections below define the types of data that can passed along arcs, the events that
encapsulate this data, ports that send and receive events, and the boxes - or rather their outward
facing interface, or "skin" - that exposes these ports.

## 1. Data-Types
Flo supports 6 data types:
* `BOOL` : for Boolean (true or false) values
* `FLOAT` : for 32-bit floating point numeric values
* `STRING` : for unicode character sequences
* `DATA` : an opaque (i.e. uninterpreted) sequence of bytes
* `ARRAY`: an array of a specific primitive (BOOL, FLOAT or STRING) or STRUCT type
* `STRUCT`: a user-specified (key-value) dictionary of named types.

These data types are defined as distinct cases in an `enum` called `T` (in [Events/T.swift](../Sources/FloBox/Events/T.swift), where "T" stands for "type", but abbreviated to avoid any confusion with the built-in Swift type `Type`). Instances of `BOOL`, `DATA`, `FLOAT`, `STRING` and `ARRAY` are respectively instances of the corresponding Swift language types `Bool`, `Data`, `Float`, `String` and `Array`. A `STRUCT` instance, however, must be an instance of the FLo-defined struct `Struct` (in [Events/Struct.swift](../Sources/FloBox/Events/Struct.swift)) - which can be constructed by supplying the name of the `STRUCT` type together with values for all its data members, e.g. 

    let s = Struct("XY",["x":2.3,"y":4.5])
.. will create the following STRUCT instance:

    s = XY{
          x = 2.3,
          y = 4.5
        }

The `Struct` struct provides subscript access to the values of its data members, e.g. (with `s`
defined as above):
* `s["x"]` returns the value `2.3`
* `s["y"]` returns the value `4.5`

The following `Struct` instances are predefined: 

    // a null struct    
    public let NIL = T.STRUCT("nil",[:]) 
    // for 2D (x,y) coordinates
    public let XY = T.STRUCT("XY",["x":.FLOAT(),"y":.FLOAT()])
    // for 3D (x,y,z) coordinates
    public let XYZ = T.STRUCT("XYZ",["x":.FLOAT(),"y":.FLOAT(),"z":.FLOAT()])
    // for Euler angles
    public let EULER = T.STRUCT("Euler",["pitch":.FLOAT(),"yaw":.FLOAT(),"roll":.FLOAT()])
    // for quaternions
    public let QUAT = T.STRUCT("Quat",["angle":.FLOAT(),"axis":XYZ])
    // for Date/Time values
    public let DATE = T.STRUCT("Date",["year":.FLOAT(),"month":.FLOAT(),"day":.FLOAT(),
                                "hour":.FLOAT(),"min":.FLOAT(),"sec":.FLOAT()])

All `STRUCT` types are automatically (on construction) added to a global registry, which can be accessed through `static` variable on type `Struct`:

    extension Struct{
        static var types:[String:T] // returns all registered Struct types
    }

## 2. Events
The preceding section described the types of data that can be sent along dataflow arcs. For a
couple of reasons (explained below), this data is not sent 'raw', but is instead wrapped inside a
struct called an `Event` (defined in [Events/Event.swift](../Sources/FloBox/Events/Event.swift)).
The data in the `Event` is encapsulated as an instance of the `Event.Value` protocol (also defined in [Events/Event.swift](../Sources/FloBox/Events/Event.swift)), which is implemented by each of the 6 data types described in the previous section.

One reason for wrapping data in an `Event` is that, although box outputs typically send data
over arcs, they might also stop sending data (for any number of reasons). Any interruption to the
data flow is a significant occurrence, which is modelled as an `Event` with a `nil`-valued `Event.Value`. Another reason is to allow users to attach arbitrary `metadata` (represented by an application-
specific `Struct`) to the data - which can then be used to constrain/filter data
transmission, according to application specific logic (described below).

## 3. Ports and Box Skins
From the point of view of a dataflow, the boxes representing processes are opaque (i.e. they are [black boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box)), with only a name and set of ports (either inputs or outputs) that are visible at the graph level. This superficial, outward aspect of a black-box is encapsulated by the `Skin` struct (in [Skin.swift](../Sources/FloBox/Skin.swift)) which is just a name and a list of inputs and outputs.
